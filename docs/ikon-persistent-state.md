# Ikon Persistent State Guide

How to persist app state across restarts. Read this before reaching for files or hand-rolled storage.

## TL;DR — what to pick

```csharp
// Default for almost everything you want to persist:
private readonly PersistentSessionReactive<MyState> _state = new(new MyState());

// Read and write like any reactive:
_state.Value = next;
var current = _state.Value;
```

That's it. The framework loads from cloud storage before `Main()` runs and saves on graceful shutdown. No file paths, no `Directory.CreateDirectory`, no AssetUri ceremony.

## Three scopes — pick by who shares the value

| Class | Same value seen by | When to pick |
|---|---|---|
| `PersistentReactive<T>` | All session identities, all users (app-wide within space) | Truly app-wide config. Rare — most apps don't need this. |
| **`PersistentSessionReactive<T>`** | The same SessionIdentity (the app's routing key) | **Default.** One app instance = one bucket of state. |
| `PersistentUserReactive<T>` | The same UserId, across all of their sessions | State that follows a user (preferences, history, profile). |

Heuristic: if you can't articulate why it should be `Global` or `User`, it's `Session`. The session identity is what the app already declared as its routing key — using the same key for storage means your data partitions match how your app instances partition.

Each scope also has persistent collection variants — `PersistentReactiveList<T>` / `PersistentSessionReactiveList<T>` / `PersistentUserReactiveList<T>`, and the same trio for `ReactiveHashSet<T>` and `ReactiveDictionary<TKey, TValue>`. Use these instead of wrapping a collection in a `Persistent...Reactive<List<T>>`.

The user-scoped classes additionally expose per-user accessors usable outside an active user scope (background tasks): `ValueFor(userId)`, `SetFor(userId, value)`, and `UpdateFor(userId, ...)` on `PersistentUserReactive<T>`; the collection variants have equivalents like `AddFor` / `RemoveFor` / `ClearFor`.

## Three backends — pick by what you store

```csharp
// Default — small/medium structured state
new PersistentSessionReactive<Prefs>(new Prefs());

// Public asset URL needed (uploaded images, published files)
private readonly PersistentSessionReactive<byte[]> _logo
    = new([], backend: PersistenceBackend.Public);

// Then read the URL after first save:
var url = _logo.PublicUrl;  // null until first save completes

// Small, frequently-mutated value, app has a postgres DB declared
private readonly PersistentSessionReactive<long> _counter
    = new(0, backend: PersistenceBackend.Postgres, postgresDatabase: "main");
```

Rules:

- `Private` (default) — S3-backed cloud file. Use for anything that doesn't need a public URL.
- `Public` — same backend but the asset gets a public URL on `PublicUrl`. **Only** when the value will be linked to from the open web. Don't use for anything sensitive.
- `Postgres` — one row in the `ikon_reactive_storage` table in a postgres DB the app declares with `Databases = ["name:postgres"]` in `ikon-config.toml`. **Only** for small, frequently-mutated values (counters, status flags, small JSON). Never for binary blobs, large lists, or images. If the app has only one postgres DB, omit `postgresDatabase`. If there are several, name the one you want.

Backend ≠ scope. Scope decides who sees the value; backend decides where it lives. They're chosen independently.

## The `key:` parameter — only for loops

```csharp
// WRONG — every loop iteration creates a reactive with the SAME stable id.
foreach (var camera in cameras)
{
    var baseline = new PersistentSessionReactive<byte[]>([]);  // collisions!
}

// RIGHT — explicit stable key derived from the dynamic identity.
foreach (var camera in cameras)
{
    var baseline = new PersistentSessionReactive<byte[]>(
        [],
        key: $"baseline:{camera.Id}");
}
```

Pass a stable identifier the app owns. Not `Guid.NewGuid()` — that changes on every restart and orphans the old data. Don't reuse the same key across different types or scopes.

You almost never need `key:` for fields. Field names are already stable. Only reach for it when constructing reactives in a loop or based on runtime identity.

## Save semantics

- **Load**: parallel for all persistent reactives, finishes before `Main()` runs. Your code sees persisted values from the start. (User-scoped reactives load per user: the primary user's partition is preloaded before `Main()`; other users' partitions load lazily the first time their scope is touched.)
- **Save**: parallel for all persistent reactives, on `StoppingAsync` (graceful shutdown).
- **Crashes lose unsaved changes.** If a value must survive a crash, also write it through a side-channel (webhook, direct DB, …). Don't try to bolt save-on-every-change on top — for high-write durability, store it in postgres directly through `app.Databases`.

## Anti-patterns — don't do these

- ❌ `Path.Combine(app.DataDirectory, "data")` + `Directory.CreateDirectory(...)` for runtime state. `DataDirectory` is **read-only** in cloud. It's for bundled assets the app reads, not state it writes.
- ❌ Using `Postgres` backend for binary blobs, image bytes, or unbounded lists.
- ❌ Using `Public` backend for anything sensitive — assets get a real URL on the open web.
- ❌ Constructing AssetUris by hand for state that fits a `PersistentXxxReactive`.
- ❌ Using `Guid.NewGuid()` as `key:` — it changes on restart.
- ❌ Assuming the `Postgres` backend reads or writes through on every access — like the other backends, the row is only read at load and written at save; in between, the value lives in memory. For read-your-writes durability, go through `app.Databases` directly.

## When to drop down to `Asset.Instance` directly

Reach for `Asset.Instance` (with a hand-built `AssetUri`) only when:
- You need to list files (`Asset.Instance.ListAsync`), not just read/write a known one.
- You need streaming reads/writes for very large files (multi-GB).
- The data isn't naturally a typed reactive value (e.g., a uploaded user file you only ever fetch on demand).

For everything else, use a `PersistentXxxReactive<T>`. It's strictly less code and keeps your state model uniform.
