  // Three ways to send audio, by pacing: SpeakAsync / SendSpeech are real-time paced by the speech mixer and new speech interrupts current speech with a fade — the default for spoken replies. StreamAsync plays a complete clip (decoded file, generated music) paced to real time, without the mixer's interruption semantics. SendImmediateAsync transmits at once with no pacing — only for audio already produced in real time or very short clips; a long clip sent this way arrives all at once and can overflow client audio buffers. The send methods share a targetIds parameter: a null value broadcasts to every connected client, a list restricts delivery to those client session ids.
